# hello-world

Hi Everyone

My name is Grant, I'm interested in learning about Python and SQL so I can understand the capabilities of these languages in regards to data analytics and database management respectively.

I also hope to create a few programs to help automate some everyday tasks I currently use other apps for (and wish they had more features!) or pen and paper.
